                <li>Each player chooses a tree and fills it with 10 cherries.</li>
                <li>Players take turns spinning the spinner and following the instructions based on the spinner result.</li>
                <li>If the spinner lands on a number, the player removes that many cherries from their tree and puts them in the bucket.</li>
                <li>If the spinner lands on the bird or dog, the player returns 2 cherries from their bucket to their tree.</li>
                <li>If the spinner lands on the spilled bucket, the player returns all cherries from their bucket to their tree.</li>
                <li>The first player to move all 10 cherries from their tree to their bucket wins the game.</li>
